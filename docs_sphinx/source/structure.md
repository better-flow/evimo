# Project Structure
This is a brief description of the project structure:

[**objects folder**](https://github.com/better-flow/evimo/tree/master/evimo/objects): this is the location where 3d models are stored, one subfolder per object. The only required files are `config.txt` and `settings.txt`. See [adding a new object](https://github.com/better-flow/evimo/wiki/Adding-a-New-Object) tutorial for detailed description.

[**config**](https://github.com/better-flow/evimo/tree/master/evimo/config): an example folder containing dataset configuration (including camera intrinsics/extrinsics); this is also the default dataset configuration folder used with the online tool. See more here: [dataset configuration folder](https://github.com/better-flow/evimo/wiki/Dataset-Configuration-Folder)
